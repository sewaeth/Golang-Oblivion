# Golang Oblivion

This is the integral version of the ping farm designed by @sewaeth, made to be very fast and scalable, you can use it directly on Visual Studio (by installing Golang and then VS necessary extensions, im not gonna make a guide about it) and everything is functional directly inside the console.
The only reason why im making this public is for educational purposes, absolutely don't use it for things like breaking Discord's TOS because actually it would be raelly funny.
Note: the webhooks.json needs to be populated manually with real working webhooks.
